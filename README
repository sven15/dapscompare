=== Basics ===

dapscompare searches in all sub folders of the testcases folder for DC
files and builds PDFs and HTML from those. It starts as many threads as
CPU cores are available.

=== Requirements ===

Besides daps python3 is required. Use pip or the packet manager of 
your operating system to install:
- PyQt4
- SciPy
- Numpy
- Pillow (PIL fork)

On openSUSE 42.2 run:
zypper in python3-tk python3-qt4
pip3 install Pillow scipy numpy

=== Commands ===

reference	Builds all DC files contained in sub folders of the
		testcases folder and stores images of all pages in
		the dapscompare-reference folders.
				
compare		Builds all DC files contained in sub folders of the
		testcases folder and subtracts them from the reference
		images.
		
view		Don't build files, just view results of last run in GUI.

clean		Remove all temporary files from working directories. Run
		the clean command before you use reference for the first
		time.
		
=== Parameters ===
		
--daps=''	Allows to pass any parameters to daps. The base command
		is "daps [X] -d DC-file pdf". Without this parameter,
		--force will be added automatically.

--no-gui	Don't start GUI when "compare" is finished. This flag
		will be set automatically if no Display is available.
		Without a display, rendering HTML is impossible.

--testcases=''	Sets the path to the folder containing the test cases.
		If none is set, the current working directory is 
		assumed.
		
--no-pdf	Do not build PDF files.

--no-html	Do not build HTML files. Use this parameter when you are
		not using an X Server which is required for rendering
		HTML.

--no-epub	Do not build EPUB files. *EPUB not available yet*

--html-width=x	Render HTML page with a width of x pixels. x can also be
		a list of comma separated values, i.e. 600,1280,1920

--load-config	Load config file of past runs. This option overrides all
		other file type and resolution options.
