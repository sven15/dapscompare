=== Basics ===

dapscompare is a tool for comparing documentation output. It has two main
modes:

- Reference mode: build the initial set of reference images
- Compare mode: build a set of images that can be compared to the reference set

dapscompare searches in all subdirectories of the testcases folder for DC
files and builds PDFs and HTML from those. It starts as many threads as
there are CPU cores available.

=== Requirements ===

dapscompare requires DAPS and Python 3. Additionally, use pip or the package
manager of your operating system to install:

- PyQt4
- SciPy
- Numpy
- Pillow (PIL fork)

If you install with pip, you probably need also other packages. For openSUSE,
you need to install:

- libtiff-devel
- libpng12-devel
- libjpeg8-devel


On openSUSE 42.2, run:
# zypper in python3-tk python3-qt4 python3-Pillow
# pip3 install Pillow scipy numpy

=== Commands ===

reference	Builds all DC files contained in sub folders of the
		testcases folder and stores images of all pages in
		the dapscompare-reference folders.

compare		Builds all DC files contained in sub folders of the
		testcases folder and subtracts them from the reference
		images.

view		Don't build files, just view results of last run and
		compare differing images in GUI if available.

clean		Remove all temporary files from working directories. Run
		the clean command before you use reference for the first
		time.

=== Parameters ===

--daps=''	Allows to pass any parameters to daps. The base command
		is "daps [X] -d DC-file pdf". Without this parameter,
		--force will be added automatically.

--no-gui	Don't start GUI when "compare" is finished. This flag
		will be set automatically if no Display is available.
		Without a display, rendering HTML is impossible.

--testcases=''	Sets the path to the folder containing the test cases.
		If none is set, the current working directory is 
		assumed.

--filetypes=''	Select file types.
		Default: html,single-html,pdf,epub

--html-width=x	Render HTML page with a width of x pixels. x can also be
		a list of comma separated values, i.e. 600,1280,1920
		This option also defines the EPUB width.

--ignore-conf	Ignore loading of config file from previous runs. The
		config contains file types and HTML widths of previous
		runs.
